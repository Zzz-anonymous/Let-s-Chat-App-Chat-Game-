Ideas
-----
- Group communication concept = private chat, private draw, etc.
- Game lobby concept = create, join and leave session
- Private game or room = join using passcode
- Integrate with chat = lobby and in-game
- Online user list = invite, accept and reject
- Alternating key press to move: 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ...
- Random key press to move = random alphabet for each move
- More players per game (if suitable) = use array or list
- Flexi player count = 2 or 3 or 4 or more
- Waiting room before game starts
- Viewers or audiences = observe but not play
- Multiple rounds
- Game elements: HP, life, score, item, boast, timer, etc.
- Leaderboard or scoreboard
- Different animations for different states
- Background music and sound effect(/)
- Use photo (webcam) rather than icon (/ profile picture)
- Race games: (/)
